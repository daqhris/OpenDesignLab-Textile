## Summary  
The textile-focused design workshops organised by [Open Design Lab](https://opendesigncourse.be/) and held in Kortrijk, located in the South-West Flanders region, started on __15 September 2025__. 
They ended with a group exhibition in the first weekend of the [Wonder Creativity Festival](https://wonderkortrijk.be/), open to all from __October 17__ to __November 2__, at [Cohousing Ten Broele](https://wonderkortrijk.be/exposities/cohousing-ten-broele/odltextile?location=cohousing-ten-broele). As one of the participant, I am grateful for the intensive learning sessions at [BUDA::lab](https://designregio-kortrijk.be/nl/drk-voor-jou/budalab-open-makerspace) which are a great addition to my skillsets and open a door to a machine-assisted textile arts and crafts practice.
