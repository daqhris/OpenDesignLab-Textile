# Open Design Lab â€” Textile  

## Summary  
The textile-focused workshops organised by [Open Design Lab](https://opendesigncourse.be/) and held in Kortrijk, located in the South-West Flanders region, started on 15 September 2025 and are scheduled to end with a group exhibition at the beginning of the [Wonder Creativity Festival](https://wonderkortrijk.be/). As one of the design students, I am grateful for the intensive training sessions at [Budalab](https://designregio-kortrijk.be/nl/drk-voor-jou/budalab-open-makerspace) which are a great addition to my skillsets and open a door towards a textile art practice.
